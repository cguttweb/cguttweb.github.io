    <h1>Coffee Beans and grinding</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Beans</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Arabica</strong> - c.60% of world coffee production caffeine levels vary
          c.0.8-1.6%
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Robusta</strong> - c.40% of world production higher caffeine levels
          between c.1.7-4%
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Processing</h2>
      <p>Processing is required for the coffee cherries to become beans. There are
        variations but most common methods are dry (natural) or wet (washed).
        <strong>Dry Process</strong> - using this method cherries are quickly washed and
        put into raised beds/patios and left to dry in the sun for c. 2 weeks where they
        will lose their colour and turn brown.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Wet Process</strong> - in this method cherries are added to water tanks
        and sent into pulpers which remove the outer layers and beans are then sorted by
        weight into tanks. For this washed process they soak between 12 and 72 hours until
        the pulp (mucilage) is removed. Beans are left outside to dry between 4-10 days
        covered by parchment turning them by hand to dry them evenly. They will turn light
        beige colour when fully dried.</p>
      <p><strong>Pulped natural</strong> method involves beans being added to drying beds
        outside and raked regulary to evenly dry them. Depending on the climate they are
        left for between 7 and 12 days and when completely dry are mottled with red/brown
        patches.</p>

        <h2>Types of grind:</h2>
        <p>The grind is important depending on which type of coffee you wish to make. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Super fine</strong> - suitable for Turkish coffee using an Ibrik
          </li>
          <li><strong>Fine</strong> - suitable for espresso machines and moka pots</li>
          <li><strong>Medium coarse</strong> - suitable for many brewing options including
            pour over filter and cloth brewer</li>
          <li><strong>Coarse</strong> - suitable for the French press/cafetiere</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Blends vs Single Origin</h2>
        <p><strong>Blends</strong> are a mix of different beans creating a particular
          flavour profile. They are popular because the flavour profiles remain consistent
          throughout the year. The best quality beans are usually described in detail
          including the variety, flavour and region. </p>
        <p><strong>Single Origin</strong> usually means a coffee from a single country,
          however when dealing with speciality coffee this can be more specific:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a single farm,</li>
          <li>a single producer,</li>
          <li>a group of producers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Often they are limited or seasonal options so will only be sold until the
          supply lasts.</p>
