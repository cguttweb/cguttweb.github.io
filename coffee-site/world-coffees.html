        <h3>Ethiopia</h3>
        <p>Ethiopia is often seen the geographic home of Arabica coffee, it has c.5% share
          of the world market and as a result has a rich coffee culture. Unlike other
          countries it does not have large number of farms instead the coffee often grows
          wild and is only harvested for a couple of months of the year by subsistence
          farmers. Asa result of this it has a diversity of species and varieties not
          found elsewhere with these regional varieties each with their own
          characteristics and taste including <abbr title="coffee">Limu</abbr>, The Harar
          among others. The flavour profiles are commonly distinct and elegantly floral,
          herbal and citrus notes.
        </p>
        <p>Harvest period is between October and December</p>

        <h3>Malawi</h3>
        <p>Malawi is one of the world's smallest producers with just 0.01% of the world
          market producing arabica with 500,000 smallholders involved in growing which was
          introduced in 1891 by the British. Unlike other African countries it grows trees
          on terraces to try and combat soil erosion and retain water. It is gaining
          interest for its subtle floral East African coffees. The Phoka Hills region
          produces sweet, floral and elegant coffees, the Misuku Hills with altitudes of
          1700-2000m above sea level it benefits from stable temperatures and steady
          rainfall which produces some of the best coffee in the country. The Nkhata Bay
          Highlands region has a hot, rainy climate with some of the coffee tasting
          similar to those from Ethiopia.</p>
        <p>Harvest period is between June and October</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Vietnam</h3>
        <p>In the coffee producing stakes the second largest producer in the world and
          unlike Brazil c.95% of its production is Robusta. Production here began in the
          mid 19th century and in early 20th century farmers increased their production to
          take advantage of better market prices. In a decade it became the worlds 2nd
          largest producer which saw lower quality beans flood the market, but today they
          aim for a better balance between supply and demand.
        </p>
        <p>The harvest period is between October and April</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Indonesia</h3>
        <p>Coffee production in Indonesia was introduced by Dutch colonists and continued
          because the climate is well suited to the plant and its location near the
          equator and has mountainous regions good for production. This climate favours
          the production of Robusta beans. It is the third largest coffee producer in the
          world and has 7% of the world market.</p>
        <p>The largest island <strong>Sumatra</strong> produces 75% Robusta and 25%
          Arabica with the first plantations appearing in 1888. The quality can vary
          because of logistical challenges and water can be scarce a local method gives
          the coffee a distinctive blue-green colour however it can damage beans and
          defect taints. The flavour profiles vary from earthy, cedary and spicy to
          fermented fruit, cocoa, leather and tobacco with the harvest period is between
          July and September.</p>
        <p>The island of <strong>Java</strong> grows 90% Robusta and has the most history
          of coffee production on a large scale starting in the late 17th century. The
          production flourished killing most of the trees in 1876 leading to the planting
          of Robusta with new arabica not planted until 1950s. There are fewer flavour
          profiles with coffees being heavy-bodied, low in acidity and nutty or earthy.
          The harvet period is between June and October.</p>
        <p>The island of <strong>Sulawesi</strong> grows almost exclusively arabica with
          the island accounting for c.2% of Indonesia's total crop. The majority of
          farmers are smallholders using the local Giling Basah method, but some are using
          the washed method which can add value. There are Japanese importers who are the
          largest buyers and have heavily invested to help meet the high quality
          standards. The harvest period is between July and September.</p>

          of all coffee grown in the world and with increased production elsewhere today
          the current market share of c.35%. There are around 300,000 farms ranging in
          size around the country from half hectare to 10,000+ hectares. Most of the
          production c.80% is Arabica with nearly half of that produced in plantations
          that were setup in Minas Gerais. Arabicas produced here are soft washed and
          sweet naturals with mild acidity and medium texture.</p>
        <p>The harvest period is May to September</p>

        <h3>Colombia</h3>
        <p>Colombian coffee is world famous and is a key player in the global market.
          However recently climate has had a negative effect on production with both
          temperature and preciptation increasing it affects the climate for producing
          beans favoured in Colombia.
          It is the 4th largest producer in the world and has c.6% of the world market.
          Most of the people working in the industry are from small farms with increased
          recent interest from the specialty industry. It produces solely Arabica they are
          rich and full bodied with a range of flavour profiles from nutty, sweet and
          chocolatey to floral, fruity and tropical.</p>

        <h3>Honduras</h3>
        <p>Honduras produces arabica nd holds around 3% of the world market. It uses the
          washed method and is capable of growing clean complex coffees, but a lack of
          production does hinder production at times. It offers a variety of contrasting
          flavours from soft, low-acidity and toffee-like to more acidic Kenyan style
          coffees.</p>
        <p>Harvest period is between November and April</p>

          of c. 5 acres (2 hectares). It has c.3% of the world market. The coffee produced
          is high quality but inconsistent. Moat of it is from the north where new Arabica

          70% of the coffee grown 400-900m above sea level. Improving the coffee quality
          has its challenges with low yields, poor infrastructure and limited financial
          support and technical assistance, but specialty buyers and producers are
          beginning to work together. Their coffees are slowly appearing on the specialty
          market and their popularity is growing with sweet, soft,mild and balanced
          flavours.</p>

          natural disasters, political and financial instability and producers are keen to
          improve their standing in specialty markets and continue to improve agricultural

          less than 5 hectares (12 acres). The quality has improved with several
          micro-mills built around the growing regions allowing small producers to process
          their own beans, control and add value to their crop and trade directly with
          buyers. The coffees are easy to drink with flavour profiles are a complex

        <h3>Jamaica</h3>
        <p>Although not a large producer and not having a big percentage of the world
          market some of the most expensive coffees are prudced here. The most famous of
          these are those from the Blue Mountain range in the east of the country. It
          provides a cool, misty climate which is well suited to gorwing coffee. The
          variety is expensive and often counterfeit so measures are being put in place to

        <p>Puerto Rico is one of the smallest producers in the world with just 0.01% of
          the world market and grows arabica. The production has declined in recent years
          because of climate change, political instability and high production costs. Most
          of the coffee is grown at 750-800m above sea level, but there is potential for
          growing higher altitudes up to 1338m (4000ft). The coffees produced are
          sweet,low in acidity with a smooth rounded texture and cedar, herbal and almond
          notes. Only around a third of their homegrown coffee is drunk in the country

          produces coffees with flavours ranging from chocolatey (Barahona region = best
          known), spicy and heavy to floral (Cibao region), bright and delicate and coffee
          grown around Neyba are light-bodied and lemony.</p>
        <p>Harvest period is September to May it runs almost all year round because of a
          lack of consistent climate or defined wet season.</p>
